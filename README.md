Code Description: Voice Customer Interaction in Python

The code implements a personalized voice interaction with a customer, simulating a service at Quantum Finance. The solution uses the speech_recognition, pygame, gtts, and tempfile libraries to provide a user-friendly and recorded experience through audio and text.

Temporary Audio:
A temporary directory (temp_dir) is allocated to store temporary audio files. This approach makes it easier to manipulate and reproduce sound messages during customer interaction.

Speech Recognition - Customer Name:
The get_client_name function uses the speech_recognition library to capture the client's name through speech. Repeating the welcome message in case of error or lack of response ensures a smooth interaction.

Service Options:
The handle_user_choice function presents options to the customer, allowing them to choose between different services. Speech recognition is again employed to understand the customer's choice. All interactions, such as system messages and client choices, are recorded in the log file.

Program Closing:
After the customer chooses to end the service (option 4), the program ends the loop, restoring the standard outputs to ensure proper completion.

This code provides a base structure for more complex voice assistance and interaction systems.
